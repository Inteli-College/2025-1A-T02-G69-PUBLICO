## **Sprint 1: Strategic Foundations and First Steps**

**Week 1**

We began our journey at Mantha by clearly defining our unique position in the market. Our team worked together to create a detailed **Value Proposition Canvas**, carefully highlighting how our AI-driven ERP automation sets us apart from existing solutions. Alongside this, we developed comprehensive **Customer Segmentation & Personas**, diving deep into user needs to ensure our product truly resonated with its intended audience.

At the same time, part of the team attended the **Web Summit Rio**, where we engaged with industry leaders, potential partners, and early users. The event provided invaluable insights into our product-market fit, confirming some assumptions and challenging others—helping us refine our strategic direction early on.

**Week 2**

With our strategic direction clarified, we carried out an extensive **Competitive Analysis**, carefully mapping strengths and weaknesses of key players like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, SAP Joule, and emerging startups. Anticipating potential challenges, we crafted a detailed **Risk Matrix & Mitigation Plan**, ensuring we were ready to tackle any roadblocks proactively.

On the development side, our team spent this week conducting a comprehensive review of all our documentation, from technical specifications to stakeholder expectations. This ensured everyone remained aligned and informed, forming a solid foundation for future sprints.



## **Sprint 2: Market Validation and Early Refinement**

**Week 1**

Our team explored several **Monetization & Pricing Models**, thoroughly analyzing usage-based, tiered, and hybrid approaches. After careful consideration, we settled on a hybrid model—offering the flexibility users seek while maintaining stable revenue growth.

Simultaneously, our developers refined our existing RPA scripts extensively, significantly improving reliability, speed, and accuracy. These improvements were crucial for our upcoming deployments, ensuring our automations performed consistently in real-world scenarios.

**Week 2**

We invested significant effort in producing an impactful **Commercial Demo Video** to visually communicate our value proposition. This professionally-crafted video clearly conveyed how Mantha simplifies ERP operations, becoming an essential tool for both investors and potential customers.

In parallel, we launched our public website, ensuring it was professionally designed, SEO-friendly, and optimized for clarity. Additionally, we implemented structured logging, metrics collection, and alerting capabilities—boosting our observability and giving us greater control and visibility over our product's health and performance.



## **Sprint 3: Deployment, Scalability, and Sales Preparation**

**Week 1**

Our attention shifted to carefully mapping our **Sales Funnel & Customer Journey**, assigning clear responsibilities to ensure smooth interactions from initial contact through to conversion and retention. Detailed **Financial Projections** followed, offering transparency into our expected revenues, operational costs, and break-even milestones.

The highlight of this sprint was our first-ever assisted production deployment. Carefully controlled and high-visibility, this deployment provided us essential real-world insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our current setup, proving invaluable as we continued refining our product.

**Week 2**

Recognizing the need for better maintainability, our developers undertook a significant backend restructuring. Breaking monolithic components into smaller, modular services significantly boosted our code clarity and ease of future enhancements. Concurrently, we provisioned our infrastructure on Google Cloud, establishing robust Kubernetes clusters and CI/CD pipelines designed to handle sustained future growth effortlessly.



## **Sprint 4: Strengthening our Foundations and Responding to Feedback**

**Week 1**

Leveraging the insights gained, we solidified our competitive position by clearly differentiating Mantha’s offering through targeted market analysis and refined messaging. This allowed us to confidently begin our sales outreach through strategic cold-email campaigns—generating initial traction and confirming our sales hypotheses.

At the same time, our developers tackled the critical challenge of deploying a production-grade database. We carefully designed a new schema, migrated data without disruption, and meticulously tuned indexes to handle the anticipated load efficiently.

**Week 2**

With our first live users providing critical feedback, we executed rapid post-deployment tuning. The team addressed several hot-fixes, resolved performance bottlenecks, and streamlined user experiences based on initial customer interactions, significantly boosting user satisfaction and operational stability.


## **Sprint 5: Achieving Operational Excellence and Market Readiness**

**Week 1**

We ramped up our strategic marketing efforts, publishing consistent and engaging content, enhancing Mantha’s market visibility and reinforcing our industry presence. Concurrently, our development team implemented GIP-based single-sign-on (SSO), creating a seamless, secure, and user-friendly authentication experience across our services.

To ensure our product’s accessibility matched its powerful functionality, we focused extensively on front-end polish. Our UI became more responsive, refined, and inclusive—delivering a user experience that truly felt world-class.

**Week 2**

Financial scenario planning took center stage, solidifying our readiness for investor discussions and upcoming client engagements. On the technical side, we finalized our backend APIs, carefully refactoring endpoints to align with our new authentication flow, and establishing stable, secure API contracts—preparing us fully for external integrations and future expansions.



## **Conclusion and Looking Forward**

Reflecting on this series of intense, highly productive sprints, we're immensely proud of our team’s collective efforts. Together, we solidified our market position, built robust technical foundations, and ensured our product was not only functional but genuinely user-friendly and impactful.

As we look forward, our mission remains clear: continue innovating relentlessly, build meaningful strategic partnerships, and maintain an unwavering commitment to customer success. We’re confident that Mantha Inteligencia Artificial is well-prepared to lead the charge in intelligent ERP automation.
