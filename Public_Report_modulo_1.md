# **Public Report â€“ Mantha Inteligencia Artificial**

## **Sprint 1: Foundations and Initial Direction**

**Week 1**

From the outset, Mantha Inteligencia Artificial clearly defined its strategic intent: developing AI agents to streamline and operate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. To establish a robust foundational understanding, we initiated comprehensive research into Langraph technology, AI agent architectures, and their application in complex enterprise environments. During this initial phase, the team operated in a hybrid setting, balancing remote work with in-person meetings conducted in a dedicated meeting room at one of the founders' residences. There was significant uncertainty regarding long-term strategic positioning, which prompted early engagement with a specialized SAP consulting firm. These preliminary discussions were aimed at securing early-stage funding and industry insights.

**Week 2**

Continuing our foundational activities, discussions with said consulting firm evolved, initially envisioned as a strategic opportunity to gain capital and market positioning. However, as the week advanced, these interactions gradually began to feel more and more out of reach with meaningful advancement proving elusive. The team used this period to deepen research efforts, laying critical groundwork for future sprints.

## **Sprint 2: Strategic Realignment and Validation**

**Week 1**

This phase began with intensive introspection and recalibration of our strategic approach, maintaining our hybrid work structure. The ongoing discussions with the consulting firm continued without notable progress, gradually becoming more of a distraction. Concurrently, our deeper exploration into ERP systems uncovered the magnitude and complexity inherent to these environments, amplifying our awareness of future challenges. This realization led us to consider alternative strategies, including a pivot to consulting services as a temporary measure for capital accumulation and problem identification.

**Week 2**

After further market validation, we determined there was insufficient demand for the intermediary consulting route. Consequently, we decisively reverted to our original strategic focus on developing AI-driven ERP agents. Simultaneously, we launched strategic marketing initiatives, establishing our professional presence on LinkedIn, Google Workspace, and deploying our dedicated landing page, significantly enhancing Mantha's visibility and brand identity.

## **Sprint 3: Office Establishment and Targeted Problem-Solving**

**Week 1**

In an effort to solidify our operational capabilities, Mantha Intelligence Solutions transitioned to a dedicated office environment, clearly marking our commitment to the project's success. Acknowledging previous missteps from premature technology-driven development without clearly defined problems, we prioritized structured qualitative research. This involved extensive interviews and discussions with ERP stakeholders, including company executives, IT management, and regular users.

**Week 2**

Through rigorous dialogue and analysis, we successfully identified consistent pain points prevalent across ERP environments. Additionally, we secured exclusive access to a fully functional, closed CIGAM ERP Sandbox, crucial for focused automation and workflow optimization. Concurrently, we maintained our marketing momentum by consistently disseminating weekly content on LinkedIn, effectively reinforcing our corporate brand.

## **Sprint 4: Development Initiation and Product Conceptualization**

**Week 1**

Equipped with clearly defined targets and practical ERP resources, the team initiated development of version one (v1) of our AI-driven agent. This exploratory phase emphasized understanding the nuances of AI integration within ERP ecosystems. Regular engagement with ERP stakeholders continued, uncovering operational inefficiencies involving repetitive manual tasks that demanded cognitive input. Recognizing this opportunity, we swiftly began strategic planning for our targeted product solution.

**Week 2**

Intensified research refined our conceptual approach, further aligning our technological capabilities with identified market needs. However, due to the intensive focus on development and strategic tasks, our landing page did not receive sufficient attention, resulting in reduced effectiveness and diminished user engagement.

## **Sprint 5: Product Development and Architectural Finalization**

**Week 1**

With clarity on specific market-driven problems and applicable technological solutions, Mantha Intelligence Solutions focused diligently on developing our core product offering. Intensive internal deliberations on architecture and technical feasibility marked the beginning of iterative development cycles, characterized by careful assessment and strategic trade-offs. Given the emergent nature of the technology and the absence of established best practices, our cautious and methodical approach was paramount.

**Week 2**

Facing tight deadlines, pragmatic simplifications became necessary; nonetheless, the resulting solution clearly demonstrated significant potential and immediate value. Acknowledging the strategic importance of our digital presence, we revamped and relaunched our landing page, aligning it closely with our enhanced product positioning. Looking forward, plans are firmly established for a more robust and refined version two (v2), slated for release within the next ten weeks, solidifying Mantha Intelligence Solutions' ongoing commitment to innovation and excellence in ERP automation.
